Veltis is a social proof plugin which streams most recent customer & visitors actions (new order, sign-up, demo request) on your
website to gain trust and boost conversions. We help your visitors feel confident about their buying or sign-up decisions.

== Description ==

[Veltis](https://veltis.io) Increase Your **Conversion By ~15%** With Social Proof Notifications.

Whether you're running an online store or asking for emails on your landing page, or want to just get more comments on your blog you'll simply get better results thanks to Veltis notifications.

Trust is one of the key factors in converting customers online. About 98% of visitors leave your website without taking any action. Most of them don’t believe you can be trusted. They don’t know you and how popular your website is.

Our app turns real-time data into social proof messages. These notifications show how busy your website is, how popular your products and services are, and many more. All this instantly builds trust and credibility. Social proof notifications help your audience feel confident about their purchase or sign-up decision.

* "*Recent activity*" - shows demo requests / products purchases / signups that have just happened recently on your website.
* "*Events Counter*" - shows the total number of people who have recently signed up, started a free trial, or made orders on your website in a given period of time.
* "*Live Visitors Counter*" - shows the number of people currently viewing your site
* "*Product popularity*" - notification designed for e-commerce websites. It's displayed only on the product description page and shows the recent purchases made for this product in your WooCommerce store.
* "*Reviews & Testimonials*", "*Total Visits Counter*" and many more :) [Read Full Product Overview](https://veltis.io/product/)
